BIOGRAPHY UNDER CONSTRUCTION

Los Angeles-based art photographer Suhni California seeks the profound disguised in the profane. And vice versa.

Her most recent works often combine found images, street photography, famous people and places, well known art, text, colors, shapes
merged in layers and presented as distinct pieces with an element of pathos and humor. The juxtaposition of seemingly unrelated images and words, to create an unexpected reaction.
